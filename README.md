# ITN-Hybrid

This repository has the Solidity code of the Proof of Stake and Proof of Work contract as well as the mining software.

For the documentation of the miner see my other repository with "Miner Documentation". 

How to start staking?
- Go to the staking contract on etherscan: https://etherscan.io/address/0x5cda2019d03e0af7ec28114327707872fd16f412#code 
- Go to the "write contract" tab
- Connect with MetaMask by clicking "connect with MetaMask"
- Click the "startMint" button. 

And that's it!

If you want to claim your reward (possible after a minimum of 1 month) simply do the same but click on the "stopMinting" button instead of the "startMint" button.
